#My Portfolio Page-StrikingWebDesigns

##About the Project
I created this project to serve as a medium to display personal projects I have completed as I strive to navigate a career change and jump into the web development field. My portfolio site will also help potential employeers or clients get in contact with me via the contact form. I also plan to use this stie as a spring board for future feelance work where I can add client testimonials.

##What I learned
This was my third personal web development project. It gave me the opportunity to reaffirm my skills using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and SASS. I applied responsive design by starting with a mobile-first approach and then scaled up for different view ports using media quarries and Bootstrap utilities. I also gained experienec with learning a new way of building and optimizing for deployment by using Parcel. I continued my learning of Google Firebase by learning how to deploy a static website. Lastly, I gained experience with purchasing and deploying to a custom domain name.
